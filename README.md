## 🏗️ System Architecture and Design Qualities

### 1. ⚙️ Scalability
- Built with a **microservices architecture**, separating core services:
  - User Management  
  - Booking  
  - Payments  
  - Blog  
  - Notifications
- Uses **Docker containers** orchestrated via **Kubernetes**.
- Frontend hosted on a **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** for fast national access.
- Each service can **scale independently** based on demand.

✅ **Why it matters:** PawPoint can grow from hundreds to millions of users without downtime or bottlenecks.

---

### 2. 🔁 Fault Tolerance
- **Redundant deployment** across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
- **Load balancing** ensures traffic distribution and prevents overload.
- **Database replication** guarantees zero data loss.
- **Graceful degradation:** Failure in one module (e.g., Blog) doesn’t impact core services (e.g., Booking).

✅ **Why it matters:** Reliability is crucial — PawPoint stays operational 24/7, even during outages.

---

### 3. 🧩 Collaboration Between System Nodes
In PawPoint’s **distributed database cluster**, collaboration happens among geographically dispersed nodes:

- The cluster includes a **Primary Node** and multiple **Replica Nodes**.  
- When a user books an appointment, the Primary Node writes the data and replicates it instantly to all replicas.
- This ensures **real-time synchronization** and **instant failover** — if the primary fails, a replica takes over seamlessly.

✅ **Why it matters:** This collaboration guarantees **data consistency** and **fault tolerance**, ensuring reliability and trustworthiness.

---

### 4. ☁️ Distributed Cloud System
PawPoint runs on a **distributed cloud infrastructure** spread across multiple data centers:

- **Frontend:** Deployed to cloud storage and distributed via a CDN.  
- **Backend APIs:** Containerized and orchestrated by **Kubernetes**.  
- **Database:** Managed cloud service with **replication across AZs**.  
- **Storage:** Cloud-based file storage for uploads and images.

✅ **Why it matters:** No single point of failure — even if one data center fails, PawPoint continues operating seamlessly.
